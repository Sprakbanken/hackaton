## Where
The National Library of Norway (NLN) (at Solli plass, Oslo)  
Meeting room 70, entrance from Observatoriegata 

## When 
7th of November 9:30~16:00 

## What 
The Language Bank and the DH-lab at the National Library of Norway invite you to a hackathon!
Get to know our resources for NLP and digital humanities by building with them.

The groups decide what they want to work on, and we provide support

Examples of what you could do:
- explore if Norwegian texts are more gender neutral now than before
- build an embedding-fueled search engine based on non-copyrighted documents
- compare the contents of an online newspaper to the paper issue
- make an app where you can test you Norwegian pronunciation on NB-Whisper (can the model understand your dialect?)
